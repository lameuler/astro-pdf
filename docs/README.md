# astro-pdf docs

https://ler.quest/astro-pdf/

The `astro-pdf` docs are created with the [`@lameuler/atlas`](https://github.com/lameuler/atlas) Astro theme and deployed to GitHub Pages.

The API reference is written as TSDoc comments in the source code.

Guides are in the [src/content](./src/content/) folder. If you add a new guide, you also need to add it to the sidebar in [astro.config.mjs](./astro.config.mjs).
